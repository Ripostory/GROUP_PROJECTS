### Information

To load from command line arguments:
-l <file path>

If the path is valid, then the object will be loaded
If it is not valid, then an error will be printed on the terminal

Other functionality:
A - speed up
D - slow down

T, Y, and U keys will change object to other sample models
I will revert back to original model
