# PA9: Lighting

### Information
We technically had lighting working since PA5, but this is a more proper implementation of lighting

This implements per vertex and per fragment lighting, as well as a spotlight that follows the most recently spawned ball

### Libraries needed
GLEW, GLM, SDL, Assimp 3.3.1, Magick++, Bullet 2.87

### Build instructions
Create a build folder called build and do ```cmake ..``` inside of it.

Build from within the PA9/build directory via the make file generated by cmake. Simply do ```make``` to build and ```make clean``` to remove the build files.

Run the program by doing ```./Tutorial``` after building the program. 

Ensure that you don't remove the build folder entirely, as the assets folder exists in both the PA9 and build directory due to root directory differences between the IDE and Ubuntu.

### additional notes

note: uses assimp version 3.3.1
note: uses magick++ (sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev)
note: uses bullet 2.87 (build and do make install)
